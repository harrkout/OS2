LAB 1 - Technical Report & Code

Lab1 examines the following two questions. Please upload to ECLASS a single zip file that contains solutions to each question (see -->) before the deadline.

[2 points] Question 1: Binary Bomb and GDB

A "binary bomb" is a Linux executable C program that consists of several "phases." Each phase expects the student to enter a particular string on stdin.  If the student enters the expected string, then that phase is "defused."  Otherwise the bomb "explodes" by printing "BOOM!!!".  

The goal is to experiment and defuse at least one phase (phase_1) of *lab1_b_bomblab*. Hint: Use the debugger (gdb) to follow program execution, as well as objdump and readelf tools to find out what is happening (in x86 assembly code, data, and registers). Set breakpoints to isolate the part where critical things are happening.

-> Your report is a typescript file that registers your best effort. 

To generate this file, 
a) first type "script" in the Linux command line (before you call gdb), and 
b) then press ctrl-d when finished, to save everything in between in file typescript (newly created file in the current directory).

[3 points] Question 2: Reducing the size of an executable

Examine the following 3 questions.

1) What is the best way to compile & link when generating a small executable?

2) Can you make your executable even smaller? Hint: Read related documents from Julia Evans and others from *lab1_a_min_code*. You can also find others on the web.

3) Can you apply those technqiques (in 1 & 2) in our example 02_static_dynamic_link and compare the code sizes. How much smaller is your final executable?  

-> Your report answers questions 1-3 above and provides also an executable file (elf format) of your best (minimal size) solution in a zip file.
